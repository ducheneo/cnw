compose_newwindow changes the behavior of the default compose / reply /
forward buttons in the main mail list so that they open the new message in 
a separate window (or tab depending on your browser settings)

The compose window is also slightly modified (using a css file) to hide
the main toolbar and move the rest of the items up accordingly.

If you are using a custom skin the plugin will look in the 
plugins/compose_newwindow/skins directory for corresponding
subdirectories and use the file compose.css from that directory
if found.

Installation
------------
Add the plugin to your config/main.inc.php

ToDo: 
- Add user option to enable / disable compose in new window.
- Get the reply,etc. options in the contextmenu plugin to work the same.
- Possibly display the message send results popup in the Main Window
