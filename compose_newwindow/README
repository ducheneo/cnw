compose_newwindow changes the behavior of the default compose / reply /
forward buttons in the main mail list so that they open the new message in 
a separate window (or tab depending on your browser settings)

The compose window is also slightly modified (using a css file) to hide
the main toolbar and move the rest of the items up accordingly.

Note: in order for this to work properly you may have to disable the
popup blocker in your browser for the webmail site.

If you are using a custom skin the plugin will look in the 
plugins/compose_newwindow/skins directory for corresponding
subdirectories and use the file compose.css from that directory
if found.

Installation
------------
Add the plugin to your config/main.inc.php

Configuration
-------------
The plugins default options can be set by copying the config.in.php.dist
file to config.inc.php in the plugin directory and editing the file.

ToDo: 
- Get message list to reload in main window on send to show changed flags.
- Improve handling of compose windows when toolbar not used, currently the
  main window spawns the popup compose window (causing an issue with some 
  browsers popup blockers) then gets redrawn using the js history.go.
- Possibly display the message send results popup in the Main Window.
